## History

**Personal History:**  
Delivered unnamed to an orphanage on Tetra-V Curtis Va’mush was named by the orphanage’s director a Bolian named Urshad Kinek, he was the sole survivor of the star ship Agripen and had been delivered by an independent freighter crew who had found his escape pod. His childhood was unremarkable as he was brought up within the orphanage as a well-rounded human who was as at ease with other humans as he was with any of the ‘alien’ species he grew up with, almost as soon as he was old enough to understand what had happened to his mother and father, he had expressed an interest in following in their footsteps and joining Starfleet.

It took three attempts to secure his place at Starfleet Academy, each year there were fewer and fewer spaces available at the Academy and the competition grew fiercer and fiercer for those positions.

**Starfleet History:**  

Once he arrived at Starfleet Academy Curtis began to excel at engineering disciplines and four short years later, he graduated as an Ensign in Starfleet where upon he was assigned to USS Mercer an Excelsior Class vessel, he stood out from day one and impressed his superiors he had the right mix of ego and ability which had him taking on tasks that other ensigns may not have felt ready for months after joining the crew. He continued to serve aboard the Mercer for 3 more years making his way to the position of Assistant Chief Engineer.
Eventually his promotion to Lieutenant came through and with it a new posting aboard USS Cario a newer Intrepid Class ship as the ships Chief Engineering Officer where he once again excelled at his job resolving several lingering issues with the ship missed during its earlier cruises. It was aboard the Cario he met his future fiancé Matilde Truscott who served aboard the ship within its science department their romance growing over the years they were both assigned to the ship.
Disaster struck a few short days following his proposal to Matilde, the Cario was taking part in a research project to test out an experimental new shielding system designed to defeat the Borg and reduce damage taken by their cutting beams up to 60%. The test route took them close but not in to the Cagliosie Nebula a strange area of space that Starfleet had declared off limits back when Pike commanded the Enterprise.

There was only one legitimate reason to enter that area of space and that was in response to a distress call as back then Starfleet still valued life above all other concerns. Upon hearing that they were going to enter the nebula an area known to have pocket tachyon storms Va’mush advised the Captain to disable the experimental systems and proceed on standard shielding alone. Were it not for the vehement protests of the shields creator who was onboard the Cario during the tests the Captain would have done as Curtis suggested, however the threats, tantrums and demands of the chief scientist to give his shielding system a thorough test outweighed the good advice of the ships Chief Engineer.
Had a different decision been taken that day then perhaps the crew of the Cario would not have been slaughtered wholesale by the events that followed. USS Cario was officially listed as missing in action for six months for the crew and their families aboard it was decades and decades of time, they experienced new lives, old lives and so many terrible situations as they were cast not only through time but through space.

Their salvation came from the ships Engineering team lead by Curtis who had been shielded from the worst of the time field distortions, perhaps it was theorised later by the warp core or perhaps by something that Curtis began working on when he knew that were going to enter the nebula. After their return Starfleet classified the mission and forbade anyone to speak of it or its events again because of the barely understood temporal implications.

Ruined in distraught Curtis returned to Sol aboard the badly damaged USS Cario he took a sabbatical form Starfleet to recover from the events and the loss of his fiancé for two years he worked as an independent engineer crewing aboard a variety of haulers and interstellar liners before finally feeling ready to once again return to Starfleet.
Upon his return he requested a change of specialisation from Engineering to Command, the officer interviewing him noted that there was a fire in the young Officers eye that had not been seen there previously. The events aboard the Cario had been horrifying and almost broken Curtis by taking him to the edge of his sanity, recovering had left him hardened and changed by the experience. He was now sure that had he been in a Command position aboard the Cario the outcome would have been different.

Although there was a 2nd Officer position available aboard the Cario Starfleet Command did not feel it was appropriate to return him to the site of his trauma, instead he was assigned to USS Ronald Reagan under the command of Captain Kurt Darkly a stalwart and well-respected Commanding Officer that would hopefully nurture Curtis’ command skills.
What began as a random assignment turned in to a very successful partnership within the year Curtis had been promoted to Lieutenant Commander, passed his bridge command qualifications and been re-assigned as the ships Executive Officer. Kurt and Curtis just gelled like they were two halves of the same brain, able to second guess each other and cover for the weaknesses they saw in each other. Over the next 12 years Curtis would go on to excel and finally be promoted to Commander himself.

The only wrinkle in their relationship was Curtis refusal to take the offer off Command, his fire had been tempered further by the knowledge of what command took and whilst he was very comfortable being an excellent Executive Officer, he was not sure enough in his abilities to take on command of a whole star ship, especially not command of the Galaxy Class USS Fortuna it was just too big of a jump from the Ambassador class he knew and loved.

Kurtis knew that he would only have one, perhaps two more offers from Starfleet Command before they wrote him off as a potential Captain, he made it his focus to get Curtis into a position to take command.

What propelled him to command was a tragedy of monstrous proportions, during Admiral Taylor’s last few months in Starfleet he used the Ronald Reagan, his former command, as his method of visiting various areas under his command to say goodbye and thank them for their service. That mission was interrupted by a distress call from the Triangle a small area of space between the territories of The Federation, the Klingon and Romulan Empires. Independent star ships and facilities were being attacked on mass by Klingon vessels with some stations and planetary installations simply being wiped out.

USS Ronald Reagan was the only ship available that would be able to respond as Starfleet refused to assign any support to the Independent forces instead suggesting they return to Federation controlled space where they could be better protected. Outside the Chain of Command Admiral Taylor ordered the aging Ambassador Class star ship to intercept the Klingon forces and try to force their retreat.

Battered, bruised and broken USS Ronald Reagan limped away from their initial encounter with the Klingons after learning that House Duras had acquired a super weapon capable of destroying whole planets in a single concentrated blast, they had taken the merest hint of a hit from the outside of the blast radius and the ship was damaged to the point it was unable to sustain warp speed for more than a few seconds.

Curtis found himself suddenly thrust into Command after the death of Captain Darkly, he was critically injured in the blast and died a short time later. Backed into a corner Starfleet begrudgingly dispatched USS Gremlin a Sovereign Class star ship to rescue the Ronald Reagan and its crew, but the time they arrived the found the ship almost lifeless in space and began the process of rescuing the ships life pods. Whilst doing so they came face to face with the Klingons new super weapon whilst the Gremlin fared better than the Ronald Reagan considering it was almost 60 years more advanced than the systems aboard the aging Ambassador Class vessel it was still dealt a critical blow which killed everyone on the ships bridge.

Assuming command of the Gremlin Admiral Taylor ordered them to pursue the Klingons at best possible speed to intercept them before they reached Romulan space, Curtis was made the ships Executive Officer by the Admiral’s order after the Gremlin ensured the destruction of the Ronald Reagan by destroying it with a volley of quantum torpedoes so that it could not fall into anyone else’s hands.

When they did reach the Klingon weapon the Admiral lead an away team aboard the Klingon ship tasked with destroying or at least disabling the ship. Curtis was ordered to stay aboard the Gremlin and assume command with instructions to return to Federation Space at maximum warp if the away team failed in their mission with handwritten orders from the Admiral to prepare a Federation Armada to handle the Klingon problem.

Those orders were never needed. It took seventeen minutes for Admiral Taylor to accomplish his mission, he had taken aboard 20 security personnel, his person phaser and Bat’leH. Little is known about what occurred on that ship all that is on record is Admiral Taylor’s final message.
“This is Admiral Dan Taylor of the 22nd Fleet, I am ordering Commander Curtis Va’mush be promoted to Captain and assume command of USS Gremlin, authorization gamma sierra five five two. Tell my wife she was always the light of my life and that I am so-”

The Klingon ship exploded cutting off the transmission.

Upon his return to Federation Space Starfleet Command upheld the last order of Admiral Taylor and confirmed Curtis’ promotion and position as Commanding Officer USS Gremlin, they also uncovered other orders left by the now deceased Admiral which instructed Starfleet to set up a task force who is job it was to oversee the areas covered by the Patrol Divisions to ensure a rapid reaction force was available to handle further Klingon aggression.
