# Chapter One: Fare Thee Well #
## Priority One Comuniquay ##
Dan lay silently in his bed the chronometer showed it was a little past 2 am ship time and that meant it was 17 minutes since he last checked the time. The older he got the more this seemed to happen to him he would have twenty or thirty minutes sleep and then nothing for several hours. At home he would get up and do something useful around the house, here aboard the Ronald Reagan he felt lost for the first time ever. There was a time that this ship had been his home, in fact it had been his home for the majority of his career in Starfleet. Now everything was ending. Both his and the Ronny's retirement dates were fast approaching and that thought scared him more than he would ever admit to anyone, for a man who had been defined by his career it was jolting to suddenly not have one. 

He rolled over and fluffed his pillow before laying back down with a groan. No position was comfortable everything ached just a little, never enough for him to seek medical help it wasn't that kind of pain it just niggled at him as his constant companion. After laying wriggling some more he found a semi comfortable position only to be disturbed by the ships computer. 

"Priority one communique from Starfleet Command"

Dan sighed and then kicked the bed angrily before resigning himself to the fact he needed to get up and answer. If he didn't the ships computer would redirect the incoming call to the bridge who would wake him up. 

"On screen" he said sleepily as he stood and pulled his shirt over his shoulders. Across the room a screen slowly raised out of the desk as a steaming cup of coffee was replicated for him by the ships computer. He smiled in spite of the early hour and grabbed the drink as he made his way to his desk. 

"You look like hell old man" the smiling face of Rear Admiral Kovash appeared on the screen as he spoke. "I would have thought that being back on your old ship would have been a more comfortable experience for you."

Taylor grunted and took a sip of his drink before responding more fully. 

"You would think so Havarsh" Dan managed to wipe the dour look off of his face "but even being back aboard this old lady doesn't help my old bones recover from the years of abuse."

The Telerite Admiral nodded  

"You humans need to evolve a better body, take some lessons from the other members of the Federation."

Dan let out a small chuckle. 

"Yes you've been telling me that for the past 30 years." Dan took another long drink from his mug savouring the taste of the coffee before moving on to business "to what do I owe the pleasure of a 3 am wake up call? This is meant to. Be my last hurrah not another excuse to get me out of bed whilst you can."

Had Dan not known the Telerite for the best part of forty years he may not have been quite so able to read his facial features. Something other than the priority level of the call told him that something bad is afoot. 

"Well" he paused momentarily "we have received a sub space distress signal coming from the Triangle from civilian haulers that they are being harassed by Klingon vessels claiming the area is now under Klingon control."

"This is exactly why we petitioned Starfleet Command for more resources in this area. To head off the Klingon's attempt to take Romulan space."

Kovash nodded. 

"Unfortunately Starfleet Command and the Federation Council would rather leave the Romulan Remnants to duke it out will the Klingon Empire without getting involved."

Dan wished he could be surprised at this outcome but he had witnessed the slow decline of the Federations morals since the Hobus Incident. A small rule change here, a minor moral line in the sand crossed there and all of a sudden you were looking at a very different group to the one you remember joining. 

"Let me guess, what have the Romulan's done for us? We've spent enough resources for no gain. We simply don't have the ships."

"All three" the Telerite said quietly "it was all three reasons cited by Starfleet Command plus a mandate for Civilians to move to Federation controlled space if they want Federation protection."

A light bulb when off in Admiral Taylor's head as he watched the expressions change on the Telerite's face.  He sighed deeply before he opened his mouth to say the next bit. 

"I see. Which brings us to why you are contacting me at this hour. We are the only ship near by aren't we, the only one with the authority to intervene because I'm aboard."

The pained look on his friends face told him all he needed to know.

"Send me the information you've got I will look it over and discuss it with the ships senior staff. I can make no promises though."

"Just knowing you'll look at it Admiral fills my heart with joy, transmitting the details to you now. Just promise me one thing."

Dan's head cocked to one side. 

"What is that?" He enquired intrigued by the Telerite tone. 

"What ever you decide, decide quickly people are dying out there.  Kovash out."

The link was cut before Dan could say anything further leaving him alone with his own thoughts and a briefing to prepare for. 
## Senior Staff Meeting ##
"If I could draw your attention to the screen" Admiral Dan Taylor pointed with the stick he had used all those years ago when he was in command of the Ronald Reagan. He smiled as it was handed to him by Captain Darkly remembering the recently warp capable culture that had given it them as an honour gift for being the first space fairing culture they had met. He flexed the stick gently in his hands as he allowed himself to be lost in the memoires whilst those in the room settled themselves.

"Approximately 18 hours ago Starfleet Command intercepted a signal from a Klingon fleet indicating it had left Klingon space headed towards Romulan held territories."

The screen behind him zoomed in on the area in question, showing not only the Klingon boarder but also the Triangle and the Romulan border too. 

"It appears that on their way they have attacked and destroyed at least three colonies and one Independant Starbase."

Around the table Dan could see grim faces of concern staring back at him. Captain Darkly indicated for him to continue before he could Commander Va'mush spoke up.

"I presume Admiral that you are telling us this because Starfleet Command has not mounted a response?"

*'Very astute*' Dan thought to himself, *Commander Va'mush will go as far as I thought if he keeps engaging his brain like this*

"Yes Curtis that is correct. Starfleet and by extension the Federation Council have declared this a internal matter between the Klingon and Romulan Empires, they don't feel it is worth while risking any Federation assets as there is no sign that the Klingon's mean any harm to the Federation at large."

"Yet" Said Captain Darkly joining the conversation "There is no sign of them meaning us harm yet. By the time we do get a sign it will be a Klingon fleet sacking a Starfleet starbase or attacking a Federation Ship."

Dan could see Curtis shaking his head with disdain it was obvious it wasn't sitting well with him that the Federation wasn't reacting as it always had previously. He let out a rather large sigh and rubbed his face with his hand.

"Hang on Admiral, you wouldn't be presenting this to us if you didn't mean for us to intervene would you?"

"Your XO is a smart one isn't her Kurt?" Dan said without missing a beat "Yes Curtis that is exactly what I wish to do whilst you cannot go off responding to this message yourselves without direct orders from Starfleet Command I can. It is one of the few privileges of my rank and position that I've not had much use for in my career. That said, the Ronny is an old girl and may not be up to everything that the Klingon fleet can throw at her. I'll not order you in to the Triangle I want to hear from you the senior staff of this fine vessel. What do you think we should d-"

He was cut off by Curtis standing.

"We will be read to head for the Triangle within the hour"

"Ah Curtis I expected there to be more discussion than this."

"Oh we've discussed it Admiral, everyone here is in agreement. This is a Starfleet vessel and it adheres to Starfleet values." The other senior staff stood and arrayed themselves around the rather vocal Executive Officer. "We will make ready for whatever the Klingon's have waiting for us. If you'll excuse us we have to get to work."

Curtis left the conference room followed closely by the other members of the senior staff leaving Dan alone with his former Executive Officer.

"A force of nature isn't he" Kurt laughed "They were signing to each other even before you had finished speaking, everyone was in agreement with Curtis. The day that boy realises the respect he commands will be the day Starfleet gets the Captain I know he will be"

Dan shook his head barely believing what he had witnessed it had been many years since someone had last left his sight without being formally dismissed.

"A force of nature indeed"
## A private chat ##
To most people they would need to look out of a window to see that the ship was at warp, after the number of years Dan had spent abaord this ship he could feel it through the deck plates. It had astounded the ships former chief of the boat how the Admiral could tell even when blind folded that the ship was in motion. The memories of John Jefferson were fond memories that replayed in Dan's head, fond memories of a time he would never return too having only another 11 days left before his retirement became official.

Retirement. The word bounced around his brain like an unwelcome guest. In his mind it was only a few years since he took command of the Ronald Reagan, not the nearly 50 years it was now. 

The face in the mirror did not match the face in his minds eye.

"Stop obsessing over it you old coot" he said out loud to himself as if it would change the slightly morose thoughts in his brain, he knew that it wouldn't for it had not done so any of the times he had felt like this in the past five years.

The door chime bleeped indicating that the ships Executive Officer was here at last, Dan had co-opted the Captain's ready room for this mission and intended to use it as much as he possibly could whilst the ship was en route to the Triangle.

"Come" He said not moving from the couch he was sat on.

"Come, sit" He said indicating to the chair opposite him "get yourself a drink if you want to."

"Thank you Admiral but I would rather not" Curtis said taking a seat in the chair the Admiral had pointed at "Captain Darkly said you wanted to speak to me?"

Dan chuckled without preamble he launched in to his questioning.

"Is it just your fear keeping you from the centre chair or is there something more fundamentally wrong with you?" He asked bluntly "It is just you have been offered two commands by Starfleet and you turned both down. I need to know why before Starfleet offer you a command for the third and final time."

 Curtis was taken aback by the questioning he had not come here expecting this topic, perhaps something about the forthcoming missing, not his career.

"Well" He stopped and tried to gather his thoughts "You see." He sighed "It's-"

"Christ man" The Admiral's voice was suddenly raised "you're a Starfleet Officer not some slack jawed cadet. Act like it and answer my question Commander."

Looking up he could see a fire in the old mans eyes which had not been there earlier in his dealings with him.

"I just have felt and to some respects still feel that I can best serve Starfleet as a valuable member of this crew, not as a Commanding Officer else where."

"Oh is that it?" 

He turned slightly to face Curtis somehow looking menacing where before he had been the visage of a frail old man.

"There was me thinking there was a real reason for you depriving Starfleet of a Captain it sorely needs at a time when many of the old guard are retiring, instead you give me pure fucking bullshit."

Curtis blinked taken aback by the vitriol in the Admiral's voice.

"Sir?"

"You heard me Commander. Bull. Shit. Pure unadulterated bullshit. I've heard better and more technically accurate explanations from a Pakled."

Curtis opened his mouth to defend himself from the Admirals verbal attack but was silenced by the old man.

"The grown ups are talking Command, this is the part where you shut up and listen."

Dan stood up and began to pace the length of the ready room whilst he spoke.

"You Commander Va'mush are afraid of command I've seen it in hundreds of first officers in my time and for most of them it is the deaths kiss to thier aspirations to Command a starship, once it is in your head that you cannot do it it becomes a self fulfilling prophesy. You talk yourself out of it, you find reasons to not do it. Stupid reasons like having a bigger impact here on an aged Ambassador Class."

"USS MacKenzie, an Intrepid Class 2389. USS Provenance, Prometheus Class. 2391. Both fine ships, both would certainly have extended the impact you could have far beyond this ship and its crew. Do you honestly think you are so irreplaceable that this ship would suffer without you?"

Dan turned and gesticulated in Curtis' direction.

"I'm sure you're thinking that if it was such a problem that Kurt would have told you to leave? He has in hundreds of ways over the past few years, but you like so many XO's before you don't listen. So it comes to some angry crusty old Admiral to lay down the law in a way you understand."

"For a man of your calibre to not take command is a travesty for Starfleet, the hours and resources put in to training you to become a Captain wasted. Until a few days ago it was already too late for you, your name was so far down the command list that it would be years before you would be offered so much as a garbage scow. Since I came aboard I've had a chance to read everything in your personnel jacket and resubmit you for Command again, you will be offered one of the next available slots and let me make it crystal clear to you Commander Va'mush."

He stepped forward and leaned in towards the ships XO.

"If you do not take the chair when it is offered to you this time, it will never be offered again. Even in the height of war. You will effectively black ball yourself."

Dan breathed deeply his rant finished.

"Do you understand what I have said Commander?"

Curtis was silent for a moment as he thought about what had been said.

"Yes Admiral, I read you loud and clear."

"Good" Dan replied curtly "You are dismissed Commander."

Curtis rose silently and headed towards the rooms exit his mind still reeling from the way Admiral Taylor had spoken to him, just as he reached the door the Admiral spoke again this time more softly.

"Curtis, you are without a doubt a fantastic officer and this crew is a credit to you and your innate ability to Command, please trust me when I said you would have received both of the proverbial barrels of my shot gun if you were not as good as you are. Starfleet needs you to be the Captain that we can all see."

He final words completed Dan turned away and took up a position staring out in to space through one of the windows in the room indicating he was finally done. Stepping out through the doorway Curtis let the doors slide closed before he let out a large sigh of pure frustration, the Admiral's words still ringing in his ears.

"Command" He almost laughed to himself "I'm not ready for that."
